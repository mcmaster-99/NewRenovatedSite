PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
=================

This is my portfolio website. The intention of this 
|website is to showcase my work and let future employers
|know what languages and tools I'm proficient in. The main
|languages I used for this portfolio are of course HTML,
|CSS, and JavaScript. Other tools I used in the development
|stages were jQuery (JS framework), Gulp for minifying files
|and livereload, and Git for version control.
